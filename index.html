          <h3> Definition of a Computer</h3>
          <p class="font-italic">
 Before 1935, a computer was a person who performed arithmetic calculations. Between 1935 1945 the definition referred to a machine, rather than a person. The modern definition is based on von Neumann’s concepts: a device that accepts input, processes data, stores data, and produces output.

          <div class="resume-item pb-0">

            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>Professional Communication encompasses written, oral, visual and digital communication within a workplace context. This discipline blends together pedagogical principles of rhetoric, technology, software, and learning theory to improve and deliver communication in a variety of settings ranging from technical writing to usability and digital media design to more effectively communicate in a business world. </em></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
				  Communications skills are critical to a business because all businesses, to varying degrees, involve the following: writing, reading, editing, speaking, listening, software applications, computer graphics and internet research. Job candidates with professional communication backgrounds are more likely to bring to the organization sophisticated perspectives on society, culture, science, and technology.
            </p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				  The filed is closely related to that of technical communication, though professional communication a wider variety of skills.

          <h3 class="resume-title">Teamwork Concepts and Issues</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>No company is able to progress and compete with others if the team it is working with is not strong or have no synergy between them. The team is said to be the core reason that becomes the reason of a failure of a company and success of it too. The concept of team building should be given to every individual from the beginning stages of his career so he may be able to work along with people easily. </em></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
I believe team work helps an individual in multiple ways which he is usually not be able to tackle alone. He is learnt to bring ideas with the help of discussions and solve issues quite easily. When we work in a team we share knowledge and get to know a lot of things that we were unaware of before. Knowledge is power & teamwork maximizes the collective knowledge in the organization and it helped me in my later career. It is also brings a sense of responsibility and credibility in you.

		  <h3 class="resume-title">Social Context of Computing</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>The digital computer is the key technology of the modern era and has been central and essential to key operations in modern industrial society, including manufacturing, transport and distribution, government the military, health services, education and research. And their impact will most likely increased over the next century. We have also discovered that we are vulnerable to their malfunction and misuse, creating problems such as computer crime, software theft, hacking, viruses, invasions of privacy, an over-reliance on intelligent machines and workplace stress, each of which has created one or more ethical dilemmas for the computer profession. </em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
		  Most technological problems these days get blamed on computers including power supplies failing, phone systems going down, air traffic controls seizing up, traffic lights on the blink. Also computers get blamed for mistakes made by utilities, governmental agencies, credit-checking bureaus, the police, etc. 
		  </p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify">
		  Computers have been the cause of several major blunders: 
		  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
• Not spotting a hole in the ozone layer for the 7 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
• 22 US servicemen dying in Blackhawk helicopter crashes
</p>
<p>
• 4 people dying from Therac-25 radiotherapy systems
</p>
<p>
• Letting a scud missile penetrate Patriot missile defenses, killing 28 people
</p>
<p>
• Hubble Telescope’s “myopia”
</p>
<p>
• The Y2K crisis
</p>

<p>
Computers may figured indirectly in other catastrophes:
</p>
<p>
• 3 Mile Island reaction accident
</p>
<p>
• The Chernobyl nuclear disaster
</p>
<p>• The challenger explosion</p>
<p>• The Air New Zealand crash and</p>
<p>• The straying of Korean Air Lines flight 007, which was shot down over Shakhalin Island by Soviet air force</p>
<p>• The sinking of HMS Sheffield (during the Falklands War),</p>
<p>• The shooting down of Iranian Airbus by the USS Vincennes (during the Gulf war).</p>

<p>Computer Software was the cause of two different phone system failures at AT&T (IN January 1990 and September 1991) as well as several aerospace disasters.</p>

<p>Computers vulnerable to a variety of physical breaches, including:</p>

<p>• Segataya, Japan, telephone office fire in 1984 cutting off 3000 data and 89,000 telephone lines.</p>
<p>• Fiber optic cables eaten by beavers in Missouri, foxes in outback Australia, sharking and fishing trawlers in the Pacific Ocean and accidental cut by New Jersey repairman.</p>
<p>• A New Jersey repair crew cutting a fiber optic cable, severing AT&T long distance service in the Northeast. </p>

		  <h3 class="resume-title" >Intellectual Property</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>Intellectual Property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. Early precursors to some types of intellectual property existed in societies such as Ancient Rome, but the modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term “intellectual” property” began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world’s legal systems.</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create. The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property, intellectual property is “indivisible”, since an unlimited number of people can “consume” an intellectual good without it being depleted. Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or literature can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods’ wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law. 		  </p>
		  
		  </div>
		  <h3 class="resume-title" >Legal Issues in Computing</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>1.Privacy</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
Most people have their personal data spread throughout the digital world. Even things thought to be secure, such as email or private accounts, can be accessed by unintended sources. Most employers actively check their employees’ computer habits. Privacy has evolving legal implications, but there are also ethical considerations. Do people know how their accounts are monitored? To what extent is such monitoring occurring? As Computer World points out in this article, privacy concerns can easily become a slippery slope, slowly eroding an individual’s right to privacy completely.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>2.Digital Ownership</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
Digital mediums have allowed information to flow more freely than before. This exchange of ideas comes with a legal and ethical backlash. How can ownership be established in the digital realm? Things can be easily copied and pasted online, which makes intellectual property hard to control. Legal notions such as copyright have struggled to keep up with the digital era. Companies in the music and entertainment industries have pushed for greater legal protections for intellectual properties while other activists have sought to provide greater freedoms for the exchange of ideas in the digital realm.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>3.Data Gathering</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
On some level, everyone knows that their online lives are monitored. The United States has even passed legislation allowing the government to actively monitor private citizens in the name of national security. These measures have revived a debate about what information can be gathered and why. This debate applies on a smaller scale as well because companies need to consider what information to collect from their employees. This issue invokes a question of consent. Do people know what information is being monitored? Do they have a right to know how their data is being used?</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>4.Security Liability</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
In the past, security issues were resolved by locking a door. Digital security is much more complicated. Security systems for digital networks are computerized in order to protect vital information and important assets. However, this increased security comes with increased surveillance. All security systems have inherent risks, which means it is a question of what risks are acceptable and what freedoms can be forfeited. Ultimately, IT professionals need to balance risk with freedom to create a security system that is effective and ethical at the same time.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>5.Access Costs</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
Net neutrality has become a trendy issue thanks to legislative efforts in the last few years. The issue of net neutrality is essentially a question of access. Proponents want the Internet to remain open to everyone while some businesses want to create tiered access for those who are willing to pay. The issue even extends to private Internet usage since the cost of service in some areas may be cost prohibitive. The larger ethical question is whether or not digital exchange is now a universal right. The cost of access can impede business growth, entrepreneurial spirit and individual expression.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>These issues are essential for everyone, but they carry extra weight for those who work with information technology. It is important to remember that working with technology is not separated from ethical contexts but can actually help define a legal and ethical code for generations to come. </em></p>

		     </div>
			   <div class="col-lg-6">
		  		  <h3 class="resume-title" >Organizational Context</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>In the most basic sense, organizational context may be understood as the “background” or “environment” (not physical, but very real) in which the organization operates. And when we speak of background or environment or atmosphere, we are pointing to organizational culture.</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
Traditionally, as we know, organizational context is established when leaders
</p>          
  <p style="text-align:justify"><em>1. Declare statements of Purpose, Mission, Vision, Values, Standards an goals and then</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
2. Go about the ongoing business of building shared understanding of an shared commitment to them. We claim that one of the most fundamental responsibilities of leadership is to consciously create and sustain organizational context. </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>The following graphic is used to understand any and all organizations, no matter how simple or complex, large or small. It is used to clarify the relationship between this way of understanding context and our way of understanding content – the actual collaborative action that drives the organization forward day in, day out.</em></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
The “roof” and the “foundation” can be understood as the organizational context – who we are, where we’re going to treat each other along the way. In the foundation. We find the organization’s “come from” – the solid purpose for being, the mission, the core values, the key standards, value propositions and roles and rules of engagement. And in the roof, we find the “go to” – the vision pulling as toward the desired future, the goals, the objectives and priorities.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em> And the middle of the house represents the organizational content – the human beings who are collaborating and communicating and coordinating with each other. </em></p>

		 </div>
     
		
      
          <h3 class="resume-title"> Professional and Ethical Issues and Responsibilities</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <p style="text-align:justify"><em> This is the last of our four theme in professionalism and ethics. We focus here on professionalism and ethical responsibilities that include whistle blowing, harassment, and discrimination. </em></p>
 <p style="text-align:justify">Whistle Blowing</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The term whistle blowing gives the impression of an act of seeking public attention. This is what we see in a sports event whenever a foul is committed. The referee blows a whistle to call public attention, including that of the athlete, to the unsportsmanlike act committed. Ins some countries, law enforcement personnel use whistles to draw public attention to what they deem unlawful acts and to seek help.</p>
   <p style="text-align:justify">Different whistle-blowing methods have been used for years, ranging from traditional ones to more modern computer-aided ones.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">1. Computer-Aided Methods</p>
	 <p style="text-align:justify">Most common methods are anonymous, including anonymous remailers that use a software program to take an original e-mail, strip its header and all other identifying data before forwarding it to its destination.</p>
	  <p style="text-align:justify">2. Traditional Methods</p>
	   <p style="text-align:justify">This is a cross-section of traditional methods used in whistle-blowing. Historically, whistle-blowing has used spylike methods to pass on information to either the public or a higher authority. All methods that ensure anonymity can be used; the most common include face-to-face communication with a public person that will ensure your anonymity; talking with the news media, which can keep you identity a secret; hotlines that alert the caller identity; and writing letters.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">Harassment and Discrimination</p>
		 <p style="text-align:justify">Harassment is to verbally or physically create an environment that is hostile, intimidating, offensive, severe, pervasive, or abusive based on a number of parameters including one’s race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, political affiliation, marital status, citizenship, or physical appearance. Discrimination on the other hand is a process of making decisions that negatively affect an individual, such as denial of a service, based wholly, or partly, upon the real or perceived facts of one’s race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, political affiliation, marital status, or physical appearance. </p>
		 
          </div>
		  
		  
		 <h3 class="resume-title">Professionalism and Ethical Responsibilities</h3>
          <div class="resume-item">

            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>(i) Awareness. There are no clear signs of harassment, but in most cases harassment is manifested into the following signs: unhappiness, anxiety, discomfort, stress, and lifestyle changes. </em></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
			(ii) Prevention. The main tool for the prevention of harassment and discrimination is for an organization to have a clear and simple written policy framework setting out the procedures that must be taken if harassment and discrimination occurs. The procedures must include: awareness/education, complaint process, sanctions, and redress. 
            </p>
          </div>
      
		
		  <h3 class="resume-title"> Privacy and Civil Liberties</h3>
		  <div class="resume-item">

            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>In 1986, CPSR broadened its national program to include Privacy and Civil Liberties. Since the CPSR has played an important role in promoting privacy and civil liberties, and has also created important resources on the issue.</em></p>

          </div>
		  
		    <h3 class="resume-title"> Why Privacy Matters</h3>
		  		  <div class="resume-item">

            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>As the internet revolution moves forward we are pressed daily to give up our personal information for the convenience of reading newspapers online, buying book or to read “premium content”. </em></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><em>As our society has moved past the events of 9/11 we have seen a change in how security civil and liberties are viewed.
